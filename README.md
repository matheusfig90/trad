# TRAD: a terminal-based app to help you to keep track of your work

TRAD is a Rust terminal-based app that can be used to track and plan your daily/weekly/monthly work.

The idea behind TRAD, it comes from an article called `did.txt file` ([link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201109025745/https://theptrk.com/2018/07/11/did-txt-file/)), which was used to keep track of what you did.
